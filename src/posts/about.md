## Software Engineer 
### Building Scalable, Reliable Systems

An experienced software engineer building and operating large-scale backend systems and data platforms in production environments.

I specialize in distributed systems, streaming data ingestion, search infrastructure, and cloud-native architectures. My background spans security analytics, real-time data processing, and large-scale analytics platforms, with hands-on ownership from system design through deployment and operations.

I’ve led the design of high-volume ingestion pipelines, operated large Elasticsearch clusters, and built APIs and data platforms supporting mission-critical workloads. I enjoy working on complex systems problems, improving reliability and performance, and collaborating closely with product and platform teams to deliver durable solutions.
